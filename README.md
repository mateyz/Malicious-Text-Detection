# Malicious Text Detection
During my final year at University I studied Cyber Security and modules related to the legal impact and penetration testing of both software and hardware components.

For my final project, I isolated a prime and recurring feature of Cyber related attacks (Phishing, Scamming) and attempted to identify a way in which these attacks could be better detecteed and potentially mitigated across Networks. 

## Recursive Neural Networks
To do this, a RNN model was trained using a larger dataset provided by google containing a multitude of confirmed malicious data, alongside some legitimate email for training. Once the RNN was trained, data could be provided to the feed and it would give a percent chance that the body of text (primarily emails) are legitimate or not.

Feel free to clone the project and build upon it, a GloVE file is required- which is outlined in the comments of the project.
